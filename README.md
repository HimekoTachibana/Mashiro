## Enable Popular Mode on Pixiv

![alt text](https://github.com/kokseen1/Mashiro/raw/main/images/mashiro.png?raw=true)

This extension is not able to enable the official **sort by popular** mode, but merely retrieves popular illustrations and manga via tags.

## Disclaimer

It only works for certain *(~very~ few)* tags.

Still a WIP. Very unstable. Lots of things yet to be cleaned up.

## Notes

 - Works best with *'official'* Pixiv series tags used by artists
	 - Examples:
		 - エヴァ (instead of エヴァンゲリオン)
		 - SAO (instead of ソードアート・オンライン)
 - Character names don't work ~99%~ 40% of the time
 	 - Most popular character tags are now supported!
 - Only the most common and generic tags work
	 - Examples:
		 - オリジナル
		 - 風景
 - Only Illustrations and Manga are currently supported
